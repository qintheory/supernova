Supernova Project (Step one: polymer/glucose)
 - Web application created for Oligo Medic's new website
 - The simulation represents positively charged glucose (nitrogen, lightlighted in blue)
 - The physics of the simulation, encoded in /js/molecule.js, includes: 
    1. charges (which keep the atoms in distance)
    2. links (which tight the atoms together)
    3. gravity (which wholes the entire molecule to the center of the screen)
 - The size and colours of the atoms are expressed in /data/graph.json
 
 The repository also includes the code (/python/Molecule Binder.ipynb) that infinitely replicates and combines polymers
